I was broken from a young age
Taking my soul into the masses
Write down my poems for the few
That looked at me took to me, shook
to me, feeling me

Singing from heart ache from the
pain
Take up my message from the
veins
Speaking my lesson from the
brain
Seeing the beauty through the...

Pain!
You made me a, you made mea
believer, believer

You break me down, you build
me
up, believer, believer

Third things third
Send a prayer to the ones up
above
All the hate that you've heard has
turned your spirit to a dove, oh-
ooh
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh

I was choking in the crowd
Living my brain up in the
cloud
Falling like ashes to the ground
Hoping my feelings, they
would
drown

But they never did, ever lived,
ebbing and flowing
Inhibited, limited
Till it broke up and it rained
down
It rained down, like...

By the grace of the fire and the

You're the face of the future,
